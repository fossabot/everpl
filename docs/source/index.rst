Codename: Everthing Platform
============================

Everthing Platform is an open-source IoT-enabled automation platform.
It allows to operate different types of devices, set-up automation 
rules (if-this-than-that), store and process a history of events and
all of that autonomously from cloud services and Internet connection
(if you want it).

Documentation on Everthing Platform is slitted into a couple of sections:

* :ref:`user-docs`
* :ref:`api-docs`
* :ref:`dev-docs`

Platform itself is hosted on GitHub: https://github.com/s-kostyuk/adpl/
