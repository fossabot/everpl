Client Applications
===================

For now there are only two official cleint applications for everpl: an Android and single-page web application.

An Android client is an open-source application located at https://github.com/dot-cat/creative_assistant_android.
It's supported by the project author and is developed carefully with attention to software architecture, libraries
and used software development approaches.

A web-client is much less production-ready. The only task it was created for is to test and demonstrate the newest
features of everpl. Therefore it's quite unstable and much less elaborate. Frankly speaking, web-client was
originally started as a laboratory work :). The client is hosted at https://srgk.gitlab.io/test-bootstrap2/.
Its source code is available at https://gitlab.com/srgk/test-bootstrap2
