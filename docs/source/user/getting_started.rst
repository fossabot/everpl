Getting Started
===============

Actually, to use Everthing Platform you will need to have two main
components installed:

- the platform itself;
- and some client applications.

Platform is just an application that directly controls every object
in your system: devices, other applications, their interconnection and
interaction. It is in charge of setting-up and connection of all
components, reading of their states and sending commands. And provides
all its functions to client applications.

Client application is a some software that makes interaction with the
platform and end-user itself possible. It is connected to the platform
and allows to use all its features via some user-friendly interface.

In the next chapters you will find how to install [#f1]_ all the software
needed and how to run it [#f2]_ for the first time. Just click 'next'
button to continue.
